          <h3>What is quantum mechanics?</h3>
          <p>Quantum mechanics is the branch of physics that describes nature at the smallest scales—atoms, electrons, and light. It replaces everyday certainty with probabilities and waves.</p>
          <p>It represents a major shift from classical physics, which describes the world as predictable and deterministic. In the quantum realm, certainty is replaced by probability; we can only calculate the likelihood of finding a particle in a certain state or location, not where it will be for sure.</p>
          <p>This probabilistic nature is at the heart of concepts like superposition and the measurement problem, where the very act of observing a quantum system can instantly change its state. It's a world that defies everyday intuition but is essential for describing how the universe works at its most fundamental level.</p>

          <h3>Fast Facts</h3>
          <dl>
            <dt>Pioneering Minds</dt>
            <dd>The foundations of quantum mechanics were laid in the early 20th century by a generation of brilliant physicists, including Max Planck, Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr, Erwin Schrödinger, and Werner Heisenberg, who dared to challenge the classical view of the universe.</dd>
            <dt>The Language of Probability</dt>
            <dd>Unlike the straightforward equations of classical physics, quantum mechanics is described with more abstract mathematical tools. It uses wavefunctions, operators, and the principles of probability to predict the behavior of particles, embracing uncertainty as a fundamental feature of reality.</dd>
            <dt>Technology We Use Daily</dt>
            <dd>Quantum principles are not just theoretical. They are the bedrock of modern technology. From the vibrant colors of LED screens and the precision of laser surgery to the life-saving diagnostics of MRI scans and the transistors that power every computer, quantum mechanics is all around us.</dd>
